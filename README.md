# Voice-recognition-and-Ai-response
This is a Voice Recognition and AI Response Project developed using Python. The project acts as an interactive voice assistant that listens to the user's speech, converts it to text, generates an intelligent response using OpenAI's API, and provides an audio response using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
